# Introduction
This is an attempt to recreate the famous Logisim software used to design and simulate digital circuits. The project will utilise modern C++ and modern OpenGL(3.3) along with GLFW to handle graphic related load. The main goal of the project is to realise the applications of Object-Oriented Programming with memory-safe constructs in C++, while creating a solid(flexible upto some extent) rendering framework in OpenGL to apply various graphic concepts(such as object picking).

# Progress
- [x] Create a basic framework, involving logger, shaders, textures, renderers, entities and viewport windows(framebuffers).
- [x] Have a grid system(coordinate system) and an input handler in place.
- [x] Create gate, wire and switch entities as well as a dedicated renderer.
- [ ] Establish Socket-Socket communication. (work in progress)
- [ ] Introduce an object-picking system for user to interact with the circuits.
- [ ] Create a toolbar interface with icons and texts.
- [ ] Establish different modes / states for the application.
- [ ] Create a file system to save progress.
- [ ] Create a project space for user to browse through project directories.
