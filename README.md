# logisim_clone
An attempt to recreate the famous Logisim software used to design and simulate digital circuits. 

# Progress
1. Create a basic framework, involving shaders, textures, renderers, entities and viewport windows(framebuffers). [x]
2. Have a grid system(coordinate system) in place.
3. Create gate and wire models, as well as a dedicated renderer.
4. Introduce an object-picking system for user to interact with the circuits.
5. Create a file system to save progress.
